## 🧠 Algorithm Overview

### Core Components

1. **Multi-Start Greedy + 2-opt**: Generates high-quality initial solution
2. **Branch and Bound**: Exact search with mathematical optimality guarantee
3. **MST Lower Bounds**: Minimum Spanning Tree for efficient pruning
4. **Adaptive Thresholding**: Dynamic search space reduction

### Mathematical Foundation

The algorithm uses Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) calculations to compute exact lower bounds, ensuring mathematical proof of optimality for the found solutions.
